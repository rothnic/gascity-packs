For `worktree_lifecycle=new`, use the imported Gas City
[managed runtime recipe](../workspace-runtime.md).
Before source access, run `gc gc workspace checkout continue` with actual native
run/plan/workspace/grant references. After the final focused commit and summary,
run `gc gc workspace runtime checks`; the captured native policy selects required
commands. Preserve the exact output OID and actual receipts for independent-acceptance.
Leave source closure to the guarded result/checkpoint and close stages.
Only `new` is supported. Preserve older or unclassified state and follow explicit migration guidance.

Managed shared-chain completion uses the same `workspace_outputs` qualification
contract. Native checks and independent review bind the managed result before checkpoint publication.

In an admitted new run, execute frozen project checks at the exact clean member OID,
then obtain a different native reviewer session through the owning formula graph.
Use `begin_review`/`complete_review`, `make_member_result` and `prepare_member_result`
before advancing any shared checkpoint. The final member qualifies all contiguous
checkpoints with `make_owner_output`/`prepare_owner_output`. Self-review or closure
cannot supply acceptance. Do not advance source before exact guarded result readback.

The native `new` item graph is implement-item → independent-acceptance →
record-result → close-source-anchor. Producer checks belong to actual implement-item
completion; accepted result and checkpoint readback precede closure. Leave
the source anchor open for the owning close step.

Write or update the item summary with these schema-required body sections,
using the exact `##` headings below in this order:

- `## Summary`
- `## Intended Behavior`
- `## Changed Files`
- `## Verification`
- `## Remaining Risks`

The `## Verification` section must include both the first verification command
and the final proof command, with the observed pass/fail result.

Write the summary as a `gc.build.implementation-summary.v1` artifact and record
its absolute path on the workflow root bead as `gc.implementation.summary_path`
before closing.
Include a Markdown coverage table. The validator only recognizes a table with
an `ID` column and a `Status` column. Use this shape:

| ID | Status |
| --- | --- |
| REQ-001 | covered |

Use mapping objects for front matter; do not use scalar shortcuts such as
`workflow: build-basic`. The top-level YAML shape must be:

- `schema: gc.build.implementation-summary.v1`
- `workflow: {id: <workflow-root-id>, formula: <root-workflow-formula>}`
- `methodology: {pack: gascity, name: build-basic}`
- `producer: {formula: do-work-item, stage: implement-item, attempt: <positive integer>}`
- `status: approved` or another schema-allowed status
- `trace: {upstream: [...], coverage: [...]}`

Trace front matter must use the validator shape exactly:

- `trace.upstream[]` entries must include `path` and `hash`; do not use
  `id`/`title`/`type` entries as the upstream shape.
- For the source anchor bead, use `path: beads/<source-anchor-id>` and
  `hash: bead:<source-anchor-id>`. For changed files or upstream build
  artifacts, use repo-relative paths and scheme-qualified hashes such as
  `sha256:<digest>` or `git:<revision>`.
- If an upstream entry lists `ids`, every listed id must appear exactly once in
  `trace.coverage` and in the Markdown coverage table with the same status.
- Coverage statuses are not artifact statuses. Use `covered` for satisfied
  requirements; do not use `approved` in `trace.coverage[].status` or the
  Markdown coverage table.

Artifact validation: this step is gated by the pack-owned `build-artifact-valid.sh` check, which validates the summary recorded at `gc.implementation.summary_path` (fallbacks `gc.build.implementation_summary_path`, then `gc.var.summary_path`) against schema `gc.build.implementation-summary.v1`. Before closing this step, verify the registered rig through native identity readback and run the validator with that explicit `GC_RIG_ROOT`. The validator is the script recorded as `gc.check_path` on the validation loop control bead (the dependent of this step bead whose `gc.kind` is `ralph`); Gas City resolves it to this pack's own `build-artifact-valid.sh` asset, so nothing has to be copied into the rig. Run `GC_BEAD_ID=<claimed-step-id> GC_RIG_ROOT=<launcher-rig-root> "<gc.check_path>"`; fix every reported validation error before setting `gc.outcome=pass`. On repair attempts (`gc.attempt` greater than 1), read the validator errors from `gc.attempt_log` on the validation loop control bead (the dependent of this step bead) and repair the summary in place instead of rewriting it. Two bounded repair attempts follow the first failure; exhausting them closes this stage with `gc.outcome=fail` and machine-readable validation errors that block downstream stages. Never ask questions in headless mode; record unresolved ambiguity inside the summary.
