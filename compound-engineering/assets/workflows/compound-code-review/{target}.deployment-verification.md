Retain `worktree_lifecycle` {{worktree_lifecycle}} from the captured run.
`new` requires the composed native workspace helpers and captured check policy.
Keep the methodology below. Its legacy source/path/state operations apply
only to explicit `legacy`; the managed instructions govern an admitted `new`
run. Unknown modes or failed reads never authorize legacy fallback.
Resolve helper modules through the imported Gas City `assets/scripts` layer;
keep that resolved directory on Python's import path for sibling modules.

For an admitted `new` review, use the exact canonical binding and
canonical/result hashes from this expansion's setup context. Validate the
subject with `workspace_review.canonical_subject` before inspecting source.
Use `workspace_outputs.snapshot` before and after the lane to confirm the
recorded workspace, clean index and full output OID. Review and synthesis are
read-only source work. Record this lane's finding/report hash against that
subject; never choose a default ref, launcher or newer commit. Conditional
skips retain the same subject and the required skip artifact. A missing,
stale or changed context blocks instead of producing approval.

Check deployment readiness with the installed Compound Engineering deployment
verification agent.

This bead only runs after the cheap conditional gate selected deployment
verification for this change. Produce Go/No-Go deployment checks, read-only
verification queries, rollback concerns, and monitoring focus areas. Do not
re-run applicability as a no-op; skipped deployment-verification lanes are
closed by the gate.

Read `gc.build.code_review_context_path` from the workflow root. Write this lane
artifact to `{{artifact_root}}/code-review/deployment-verification.md`. Close
with `gc.outcome=pass`, `code_review.review_verdict=approve|iterate`, and
`code_review.lane_report_path=<lane artifact path>`. Do not set
`code_review.verdict` or `code_review.report_path`; the apply-review-findings
lane owns the final loop verdict consumed by the approval check.

Do not invoke provider-native subagents. You are the Gas City lane for this CE
conditional agent.
